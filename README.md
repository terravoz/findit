# Getting started on a Drupal project

This guide helps you jumpstart working on a Drupal project with Agaric. It assumes you are familiar with git and working on the command line.

## Install Virtualbox and Vagrant

Download and install Virtualbox on your system from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.
Download and install Vagrant on your system from http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html.

## Clone the repository and create a virtual development environment

    $ git clone git@github.com:terravoz/findit.git
    $ cd findit
    $ vagrant up

If this is your first project using the box specified in the Vagrantfile it will be downloaded. This can take a while.

## Fetch database and files

If there is already a test server with a database, you may fetch data and files from the test server when the virtual machine is ready:

    $ vagrant ssh
    $ cd /vagrant
    $ drush si -y

## Tell git who you are

    $ git config --global user.name "Jean R. Hacker"
    $ git config --global user.email "jean@agaric.com"

If you prefer different identities for other projects replace *global* with *local* in the above command.

## Create a personal excludesfile

    $ touch ~/.gitignore
    $ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore

> Patterns which a user wants git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the user’s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by core.excludesfile in the user’s ~/.gitconfig. — gitignore manual page

## Develop

Pick a ticket, create a branch referencing the ticket number, e.g. `git checkout -b project-123`. Commit your code in small chunks capturing logical steps and follow the [Drupal coding standards](https://drupal.org/coding-standards) and the [guidelines for commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html). All configuration that accompanies your code, e.g. creating fields and content types, must be scripted in an update hook. Once your work is done request a review and eventually your code will get merged into the master branch.
